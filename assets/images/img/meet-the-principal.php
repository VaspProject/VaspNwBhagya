                                    <p>Human life consists of essentially four aspects- the physical, mental, emotional,
                                        and spiritual level of existence. To find balance, wholeness, and fulfillment,
                                        we need to heal, develop and integrate all these four aspects of our existence.
                                        Our physical aspect is our ability to survive and thrive in the material world
                                        by taking care of the human body and developing skills to sustain it. Our mental
                                        realm is our intellect, our ability to think and reason. The mental level of
                                        human existence consists of our thoughts, attitude, beliefs, and value system.
                                        Developing the mental faculties of our being allows us to think clearly, remain
                                        open-minded, yet discern intelligently. Our minds enable us to gather knowledge
                                        and wisdom from our life experiences and the world around us.</p>

                                    <p>To achieve wholeness and lead healthy, satisfying, and balanced lives, we need to
                                        focus on understanding, developing, healing, and integrating each of the
                                        above-mentioned aspects. Here at SFS, we do consider that all these four aspects
                                        are equally important. It is our solemn commitment to ourselves that we shall be
                                        doing everything to build up the totality of the child by focusing on all the
                                        aspects of human life by nurturing them from childhood. A total and a complete
                                        person is not only our endeavor but our commitment and passion to ourselves.
